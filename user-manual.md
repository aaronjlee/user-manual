## My style
* I’ve been hard-wired as a problem solver. Present me with any challenge, and I will see it as a problem, or a distraction from a key problem, where we can find a solution.
* It’s easiest for me to think out loud with someone else, talk through an idea, sketch it out and write it down from there.
* I like to get up early and get into the office early. It’s hardest for me to work late and stay up late.
* I love digital technologies and testing out new platforms into my workflow, from text editors to storage tools to messaging apps.

## What I value
* I value being on time to meetings and getting things done. When I can’t get things done on time, I make sure the delay is communicated early to find either an alternative, a quick fix or at least offset any surprises.
* I value working within a strict schedule of weekly hours. I make sure that each of those hours are productive. If I have to work beyond 40 hours, I am extremely particular with my teamwork, goals and tasks so I can be focused on the work that is needed to be done within a limited time frame.
* I love clear communication in speaking, writing and visual design. I’m by far not the best at communication, so I have an immense respect for others who are able to do so skillfully and artfully. Feel free to coach me too.
* Trust and honesty are critical to me. If someone breaks my trust, it is very hard to get it back. If it happens, we need to have a serious conversation and long-term plan to rebuild that trust.

## What I don't have patience for
* If you make a mistake, don’t hide it from me. I will be okay if we can address it immediately, fix or remedy it, and make sure it doesn’t happen again.
* I get easily impatient during circular conversations. I’m often inclined to close those meetings quickly if it seems that no resolution is being reached. When you have a way to help close the loop in such meetings, I owe you a giant debt of gratitude.

## How to best communicate with me
* I prefer exchanging emails first and having meetings second. Meetings are still important—sometimes we achieve solutions in a meeting we could never get via email.
* I work best in meetings with clear goals, discussion points and desired outcomes. If I go into a meeting without this sort of clarity, there’s a chance I might send out something to help structure the meeting.
* It’s good to disagree with me because I have major blind spots of which I’m often unaware. If I seem too brittle in the moment, it always helps to prod me by asking a question (“How do you think about...?”) to help me take a pause.

## How to help me
* I can get stuck working in an area where I might have a gap in perspective or skills. If you recognize me being stuck, please offer to help situate me—whether it be talking through what I might be struggling with, coaching me toward finding a solution on my own, or even lending a hand.
* I can get easily distracted and off-track in a conversation. If you sense that I’m drifting outside of the topic at hand, it’s okay to rein me back.

## What people misunderstand about me
* While I may seem like an extrovert, I internally feel much more like an introvert. When I spend lots of time with others at workshops or dinners, I often feel drained and need some alone time to recover.
* When I’m working in a corner or wearing ear buds, it’s not because I don’t like working with the team. It’s easiest for me to build out documents alone and without interruption. I fall off track when my work falls apart. If you need to connect with me about something non-urgent, it’s always best to send me an email or message so we can connect at a later point.
* I can be extremely intense and seem hard-headed. I can speak with conviction, which makes it easy to perceive me as indifferent to others’ opinions. I’m sincerely open to the notion that my opinions are faulty. Help me understand gaps in my understanding, regardless of how confident I might seem, and I’ll be very happy to change course.
